### Project Summary

**TravelTide Customer Segmentation and Personalized Rewards Program**

TravelTide, a rapidly growing e-booking startup founded in April 2021, is known for its best-in-class data aggregation and search technology, offering the largest travel inventory in the industry. Despite its technological strengths, TravelTide has faced challenges with customer retention. To address this, the company aims to enhance customer retention through a personalized rewards program.

Led by Elena Tarrant, the new Head of Marketing and a renowned expert in customer retention strategies, the project focuses on understanding customer behavior to offer five tailored perks: free hotel meals, free checked bags, no cancellation fees, exclusive discounts, and free hotel nights with flights.
