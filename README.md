### Project Summary

**TravelTide Customer Segmentation and Personalized Rewards Program**

TravelTide, a rapidly growing e-booking startup founded in April 2021, is known for its best-in-class data aggregation and search technology, offering the largest travel inventory in the industry. Despite its technological strengths, TravelTide has faced challenges with customer retention. To address this, the company aims to enhance customer retention through a personalized rewards program.

Led by Elena Tarrant, the new Head of Marketing and a renowned expert in customer retention strategies, the project focuses on understanding customer behavior to offer five tailored perks: free hotel meals, free checked bags, no cancellation fees, exclusive discounts, and free hotel nights with flights.

**Project Objectives:**
1. Validate customer interest in the proposed perks.
2. Personalize rewards based on customer data to enhance retention.

**Methodology:**
- Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy and handled outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Gained insights into customer demographics and behaviors.
- Feature Engineering: Created new metrics like average checked bags, average base fare, length of stay, and flight distance.
- Clustering: Grouped customers based on similar characteristics to identify distinct segments.
- Perk Assignment: Mapped perks to customer segments using fuzzy segmentation to ensure precision.

**Key Insights:**
- Predominantly female customer base (88%).
- Majority are unmarried (56%).
- Most users have low engagement in page clicks and book few flights and hotels.
- Age distribution highlights a diverse range of customers.

**Customer Segments and Suggested Perks:**
1. Budget-conscious customers: Free checked bags.
2. Moderate spenders: One night free hotel with flight.
3. High spenders and frequent travelers: No cancellation fee.
4. Comprehensive package valuers: Free hotel meals.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement the personalized rewards program.
2. Monitor customer response and adjust perks as needed.
3. Continuously gather and analyze customer data to refine segmentation.

This comprehensive approach is expected to significantly improve customer retention by tailoring rewards to meet individual preferences and behaviors.
